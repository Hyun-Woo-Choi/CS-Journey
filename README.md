# CS-Journey
CS Journey: Machine Learning Path ðŸ¤–

This repository documents my transition into Machine Learning as a non-CS major. It contains my studies from the foundations of CS and ML to progressively advanced projects, showing how Iâ€™ve built the knowledge and skills to work professionally in the field.


ðŸ“– Roadmap

Month 1â€“2: Foundations

Python for data analysis

Linear algebra, calculus, probability & statistics

Algorithms & data structures (ML-relevant)

Month 3: Core Machine Learning

Supervised learning (linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVM)

Unsupervised learning (k-means, PCA)

Model evaluation (biasâ€“variance, precision/recall, ROC, cross-validation)

Month 4: Deep Learning

Neural networks: forward/backpropagation

PyTorch basics

CNNs for image classification, RNNs for text data

Month 5: Applied Projects

Sentiment analysis with BERT (NLP)

Stock price time-series forecasting with LSTM (Finance/Econ)

Transfer learning for custom image dataset

Month 6: Professional Level

Model deployment (FastAPI + Docker)

Kaggle competition participation

Reflection & portfolio write-up
